Explanation

We perform the following  queries:

For  and , we can walk and/or jump to the end of the array because every cell contains a . Because we can win, we return true.
For  and , we can walk to index  and then jump  units to the end of the array. Because we can win, we return true.
For  and , there is no way for us to get past the three consecutive ones. Because we cannot win, we return false.
For  and , there is no way for us to get past the one at index . Because we cannot win, we return false.
